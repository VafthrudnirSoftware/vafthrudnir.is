# Differences Between Quantitative, Qualitative, Objective and Subjective Data

*Qualitative* data and *quantitative* data refer to different kinds of data and
originate from statistics. Both of these types of data can be *subjective* or
*objective*. Neither is exclusive to the other.

**Subjectivity** is used to refer to the condition of being a subject; the
quality of a subject’s perspective, experiences, feelings, beliefs, and desires.
Subjective information is one person’s opinion.

**Objectivity** is the idea that scientists, in attempting to uncover truths
about the natural world, must aspire to eliminate personal biases, a priori
commitments, emotional involvement, etc.

**Quantitative** data comes from the word quantity, indicating amount. It is a
measure of something, number, size, etc.

**Qualitative** data comes from the word quality. Indicates a description of
something. It focuses on the subject’s properties, characteristics, features,
etc.

## Examples

**Objective, Quantitative:** “The chip speed of my computer is 2 GHz”  
**Subjective, Quantitative:** “On a scale of 1–10, my computer scores 7 in terms
of its ease of use”  
**Objective, Qualitative:** “Yes, I own a computer”  
**Subjective, Qualitative:** “I think computers are too expensive”
